Step 1: Data Cleaning
	--> First I apply the filter (using CTRL + SHIFT + L), and check all column 	    one by one if any one has null value or not.
	--> Here, I notice that,
		i) There is some issues in Gender column, as they contain "Men" and 
		   "M" for Men and "W" and "Women" for Women. So to remove this       	  	   inconsistancy from our data, I replace all "M" with "Men" and all 		   "W" with "Women".
		2) Same thing I notice in Qty column, and replace "One" with 1 and 
		   "Two" with 2.

Step 2: Data Processing
	--> Next, I create a group of Age to get general overview and simplyfy the 	    data.
		By applying formula on Age column 
		==> =IF(E2>=50, "Senior", IF(E2>=30,"Adult","Teenager"))
	--> Also adding Month column from Date column,
		By applying formula on Date column
		==> =TEXT(G2, "mmm")

Step 2: Data Analysis
	--> Then for analysis data, I converted to PIVOT TABLE.
	i) I want to know about the Sales and Orders per month.
		==> So, I just drag Month column to ROWS and Amount and Order ID
		    to VALUES.
	   And then Analyze tab -> Tools -> Select PivotChart, to create a chart of 	   above table.
	   Then create a new sheet "Vrinda Store Report 2022", and copy our chart to 	   this sheet. And then do some formating.
I follow above steps for all my charts and add all in one sheet "Vrinda Store Report 2022".
	Then add slicer.And connect these slicers with all charts.

Step 3: Insights

	Sample Insights from my analysis :
	- Women are more likely to buy compared to men (~65%)
	- Maharashtra, Karnataka and Uttar Pradesh are top 3 states (~35%)
	- Adult age group (30-49 yrs) is max contributing (~50%)
	- Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra channels are max contributing(~80%)
	
	Final conclusion to improve vindra store sales:
	- Target women customers of age group (30-49 yrs) live in Maharashatra, 	  Karanataka and Uttar Pradesh by showing ads/offers/coupons available on 	  Amazon, Flipkart and Myntra.
